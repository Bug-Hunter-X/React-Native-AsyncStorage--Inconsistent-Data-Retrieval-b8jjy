This React Native bug occurs when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue is that sometimes, the data retrieved from AsyncStorage is null or undefined, even though the data was successfully stored previously. This happens inconsistently and makes debugging difficult.

```javascript
// buggy code in componentDidMount()
componentDidMount() {
  AsyncStorage.getItem('myData').then((data) => {
    if (data !== null) {
      this.setState({ myData: JSON.parse(data) });
    } else {
      console.log('Data not found!'); // This message may appear even if data exists
      this.setState({ myData: {} });
    }
  });
}
```
