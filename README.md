# React Native AsyncStorage Inconsistent Data Retrieval Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug related to data retrieval inconsistencies in React Native's AsyncStorage.  The issue is that data stored using AsyncStorage may sometimes be retrieved as `null` or `undefined`, even if it was successfully stored. This behavior is inconsistent and makes debugging challenging.  The solution provided addresses the problem by implementing more robust error handling and data validation.

## Bug Description

The core problem is the unreliable retrieval of data from AsyncStorage.  Stored data may unexpectedly return `null` or `undefined` without clear error messages. This makes it difficult to predict application behavior and handle situations where data is supposed to be present.

## Solution

The solution introduces more reliable error handling and data validation.  It verifies the existence and structure of retrieved data before attempting to parse or use it in the application's state.
